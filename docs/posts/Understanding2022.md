# New Papers Accepted at CHI23: Human Augmentation and Haptics

I am pleased to announce that two papers from our team have been accepted for presentation at CHI23 in Hamburg. The first paper presents a mixed-method study of the perception of augmented humans (AHs) and offers design dimensions for creating technological augmentations for a diverse and global audience. The type of augmentation and disability were found to impact user attitudes towards AHs. The second paper proposes a novel technique for changing the perceived stiffness of objects based on a visuo-haptic illusion in virtual reality. The results of our studies demonstrate the potential for various haptic applications in virtual reality. Both papers offer significant contributions to the field of HCI, and we encourage you to read the full text of both papers on our [publications page](/publications).

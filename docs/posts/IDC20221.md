# Internal Doctoral Colloquium Presentation: Society's Attitudes Towards Augmented Humans, A design Space

The potential mass adoption of technological devices that enhance human skills poses questions about their impact on society. In a recent presentation, I sparked a discussion on how we can measure the evolution of attitudes towards such devices and their potential impact. Experts from different areas shared their insights on how this future could look like, providing valuable feedback on the subject. While the benefits of these devices are clear, it is essential to consider their potential effects on society and to find ways to measure these impacts. Understanding the attitudes towards human augmentation technologies and their potential consequences is crucial to ensure that their development is aligned with the needs and values of their users.

# Human Augmentation, Immediate Issues: Workshop at the Cognitive Augmentation Semminar at Dagstuhl

The field of human augmentation is rapidly emerging, but there are many challenges that need to be addressed to move this field forward. In a recent workshop, my coauthors and I discussed the main topics that we believe require immediate attention from the HCI community interested in developing technologies that aim to enhance the human body and human skills. The workshop generated a lot of interesting ideas and discussions among the attendees. For those who want to learn more about the workshop, please visit the [official Dagstuhl webpage](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/22491). As the field of human augmentation continues to grow, it is essential to collaborate and identify areas that need attention to ensure that the technologies developed are safe, effective, and beneficial for society.

# German PreCHI presentation: Understanding Perceptions of Human Augmentation

Attending conferences is an excellent opportunity for researchers to present their work and receive valuable feedback from experts in their field. One such event is the German pre-CHI event, where researchers from Germany present their accepted CHI 2023 papers and discuss them in a smaller circle. This year, the event took place in Dresden, and my colleagues from LMU and I were delighted to present our accepted papers. It was an insightful experience as we received constructive feedback on our work and also had the chance to engage with fellow researchers in the field. Overall, attending such events is crucial for keeping up with the latest research and staying connected with the community.

# Lightning Talk at Augmented Humans 2022 

From March 13th to the 14th, the [Augmented Humans Conference](https://augmented-humans.org/) took place in Munich, Germany, + Cyberspace. During the physical event at LMU Munich Medieninformatics, I had the opportunity of sharing my thoughts about the social effects of human augmentation in society.
The Augmented Humans Conference focuses on physical, cognitive, and perceptual augmentation of humans through digital technologies. The plural – humans – emphasizes the move towards technologies that enhance human capabilities beyond the individual and will have the potential for impact on a societal scale.

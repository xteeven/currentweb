## Cobity: A plug and play cobot control unity plug-in

## Ultramotion: Robot-Driven Ultrasound Haptics

### Ultramotion 1.0

### Ultramotion 2.0 (Extended Mid-air Haptics)

## Wearable Stimulation

### Back Stimulation Vest

### Shoulder Stimulation Vest

### Vibrotactile Wristbands

### EMStriker
EMStriker is an EMS-based wearable system to support racket player sports to train their ready-position. It detects the participant's current posture and with a gentle kinaesthetic stimulation guides the user to an optimal ready-position

### Wrist-Guidance Band
This wristband-guidance prototype features two columns of vibrotactile actuators embedded in a sweatband to support users with visual impairments, it uses Linear-resonant actuators to deliver accurate vribrotactile stimulation. It has an integration with Microsoft Hololens 2 and unity 3D besides a number of rendering modes.

## Phase-change simulations with Position-Based Dynamics
This is a physic-based animation totally written in C++ to simulate phase-change phenomena using position-based dynamics. It features a latent-heat management system and a personalized set of PBD constrains to resemble the behavior of vaporization, solidification, melting, condensation, and sublimation.
## Physics-based Virtual Reality Sketch

Phys-sketch is an immersive VR app to draw virtual objects with physical behavior, in this application, the user can create a drawing and select the type of behavior they want this object to addopt, currently it supports Solid, deformable and liquid objects. It is based on Nvidia flex for the calculation of the Physics-based Dynamics.

## Balance Haptics Framework
Ungrounded weigth simulation in VR remains to be a challenge nowadays; We developed a VR application that makes use of a wrist-worn exoskeleton to indirectly simulate weigth. In this application we simulate the inertia produced by the mass of a virtual object in VR and render it using the exoskeleton device.


## Annelida Undersea Robot Control Interface

The Annelida robot is an undersea robot built for unobstructing undersea petroleup pipelines. Its structure resembles a worm, that's why it takes the code name "Annelida". Annelida robot is operated from an off-shore platform, consequently the operation zone is categorized as explosive environment and it has very strict requirements. The Annelida remote control interface was designed to allow the operator to easily detect alerts of errors in each of the physical modules of the robot while remaining safe for operating in explosive environments.

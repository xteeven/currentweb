We achieved this by using a 6DOF robot to drive a haptic ultrasound array over a large 3D space, turning a static array into a dynamic array following the user's hand. We performed three evaluations and explored seven use cases to evaluate our approach. Our results showed the feasibility of such a system, with the motion not affecting the user's perception with high likelihood.

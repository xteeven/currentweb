Its structure resembles a worm, that&#39;s why it takes the code name &quot;Annelida&quot;. Annelida robot is operated from an off-shore platform, consequently the operation zone is categorized as explosive environment and it has very strict requirements. The Annelida remote control interface was designed to allow the operator to easily detect alerts of errors in each of the physical modules of the robot while remaining safe for operating in explosive environments.</p>',21)),t(o,null,{default:l(()=>[t(e,{title:"Intervention drive system comprising an umbilical"}),t(e,{title:"Intervention drive system comprising an umbilical"}),t(e,{title:"Intervention drive system comprising an umbilical"}),t(e,{title:"Intervention drive system comprising an umbilical"})]),_:1})])}const b=n(c,[["render",p]]),f=JSON.parse('{"path":"/portfolio/","title":"Portfolio","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"article":false,"icon":"info","description":"Portfolio Cobity: A plug and play cobot control unity plug-in Ultramotion: Robot-Driven Ultrasound Haptics Ultramotion 1.0 Ultramotion 2.0 (Extended Mid-air Haptics) Wearable St...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"WebPage\\",\\"name\\":\\"Portfolio\\",\\"description\\":\\"Portfolio Cobity: A plug and play cobot control unity plug-in Ultramotion: Robot-Driven Ultrasound Haptics Ultramotion 1.0 Ultramotion 2.0 (Extended Mid-air Haptics) Wearable St...\\"}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://posthci.com/portfolio/"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Steeven Villa Â· HCI & UX Research"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Portfolio"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Portfolio Cobity: A plug and play cobot control unity plug-in Ultramotion: Robot-Driven Ultrasound Haptics Ultramotion 1.0 Ultramotion 2.0 (Extended Mid-air Haptics) Wearable St..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-04-08T19:53:37.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-04-08T19:53:37.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1676488195000,"updatedTime":1680983617000,"contributors":[{"name":"Steeven Villa","username":"","email":"david7246@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.41,"words":424},"filePathRelative":"portfolio/README.md","autoDesc":true}');export{b as comp,f as data};

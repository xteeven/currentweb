However, providing room-scale haptics is an open challenge. Cobots (robotic systems that are safe for human use) are a promising approach, requiring in-depth engineering skills. Control is done on a low abstraction level and requires complex procedures and implementations. In contrast, 3D tools such as Unity allow to quickly prototype a wide range of environments for which cobots could deliver haptic feedback. To overcome this disconnect, we present Cobity, an open-source plug-and-play solution to control the cobot using the virtual environment, enabling fast prototyping of a wide range of haptic experiences. We present a Unity plugin that allows controlling the cobot using the end-effector’s target pose (cartesian position and angles); the values are then converted into velocities and streamed to the cobot inverse kinematic solver using a specially designed C++ library. Our results show that Cobity enables rapid prototyping with high precision for haptics. We argue that Cobity simplifies the creation of a wide range of haptic feedback applications enabling designers and researchers in human-computer interaction without robotics experience to quickly prototype virtual reality experiences with haptic sensations. We highlight this potential by presenting four different showcases.")],-1)),e[4]||(e[4]=t("p",null,[o("You can find the fill text in "),t("a",{href:"/publications"},"Publications")],-1)),l(n,{"show-arrow":""},{default:p(()=>e[0]||(e[0]=[t("img",{class:"carousel-img",src:d},null,-1),t("img",{class:"carousel-img",src:g},null,-1),t("img",{class:"carousel-img",src:m},null,-1),t("img",{class:"carousel-img",src:b},null,-1),t("img",{class:"carousel-img",src:h},null,-1)])),_:1})])}const j=i(y,[["render",f]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/MUC2022.html","title":"New Paper Published + Presentation: Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots into Unity3D","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"study","date":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Conference","Paper"],"tag":["MUC"],"description":"New Paper Published + Presentation: Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots into Unity3D I presented our paper Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots in...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"New Paper Published + Presentation: Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots into Unity3D\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2022-10-21T18:37:31.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Steeven Villa\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/xteeven\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://your-domain.com/posts/MUC2022.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Steeven Villa · Human-AI Interaction & UX Research"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"New Paper Published + Presentation: Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots into Unity3D"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"New Paper Published + Presentation: Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots into Unity3D I presented our paper Cobity, a plug and play toolbox to integrate cobots in..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2022-10-21T18:37:31.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"MUC"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2022-10-21T18:37:31.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1666278612000,"updatedTime":1666377451000,"contributors":[{"name":"Steeven Villa","username":"","email":"david7246@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.11,"words":334},"filePathRelative":"posts/MUC2022.md","autoDesc":true}');export{j as comp,S as data};

It makes a patient feel better without giving them any active drugs or doing any specific procedure. The mechanism of effect relies on the patient’s expectation of the placebo’s effectiveness, which results in a positive evaluation after treatment and at times in objective physiological changes. In HCI, user study participants know the new system or method and can tell the difference between the experimental conditions. Instructions might even explicitly describe the evaluated systems’ enhanced usability or user experience and, hence, set participants’ expectations. Thus, a placebo effect in HCI would consist of a participant’s favorable evaluation of effectiveness after the interaction. <strong>This workshop helps researchers and practitioners control for the placebo effect and sets new standards for evaluating usability and user experience in HCI.</strong></p><h2 id="workshop-format" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#workshop-format"><span>Workshop Format</span></a></h2><p>In order to make participation in our workshop possible for those who are still unable to physically attend CHI due to financial or logistical or other constraints, we will use a physical model with a streaming option. The workshop will be a one-day event comprised of two blocks. The first block will establish the workshop’s framework and foundation, including theoretical background and a keynote. The second block will consist of participant presentations, followed by a round of feedback for each presentation.</p><h2 id="preliminary-schedule" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#preliminary-schedule"><span>Preliminary Schedule</span></a></h2><p>TBD</p><h2 id="submission-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#submission-process"><span>Submission Process</span></a></h2><p>Submissions should be in the <strong>two-column ACM format and no more than three pages long</strong>, not counting references. The talks and presentations will be in-person but recorded and uploaded on our website. Participants will be selected based on the merit of their contribution to the workshop. We encourage authors to make their research available on arXiv after the workshop. At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop. All participants must register for the workshop and at least one conference day. We solicit the following types of submissions: position papers or research statements. Your position paper can address the topic of the placebo effect in general or demonstrate how a placebo control is being used (or planned to be used) in your own experimental design.</p><p>Submit your contribution in (To be added)</p><h2 id="important-dates" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#important-dates"><span>Important Dates</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Submission Deadline</td><td>TBD</td></tr><tr><td>Notification to Authors</td><td>TBD</td></tr><tr><td>Workshop date</td><td>TBD</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="organizers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#organizers"><span>Organizers</span></a></h2><h3 id="steeven-villa-lmu-munich" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#steeven-villa-lmu-munich"><span>Steeven Villa - LMU Munich</span></a></h3><p>Steeven Villa is a Ph.D. Student in human-computer interaction at LMU Munich (GER), where he studies the limits of human augmentation.

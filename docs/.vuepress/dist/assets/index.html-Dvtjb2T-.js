As technology continues to evolve, it's essential to understand how it affects human behavior and interactions. Therefore, I am inviting students with a strong academic background and a passion for this field to join me in this exploration.
If you are interested in pursuing a thesis related to this topic and have a novel idea you would like to explore, or if you are intrigued by the concept of cyborgs, I encourage you to get in touch with me. Together, we can have a detailed discussion about potential research topics and how we can contribute to the existing knowledge base.
This academic journey promises to offer valuable insights into the impact of Augmentation Technologies on human behavior and interactions.

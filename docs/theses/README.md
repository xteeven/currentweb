# Available Topics for thesis

The following is a list of available topics for Bachelor's and Master's thesis. In addition, you will find a tentative title for your thesis, a short abstract, and the skill-set you will develop during the execution of your work. No previous experience in the topics, tools, or techniques described below is required to apply for a thesis with me. Yet, if you don't have any programming experience, you may consider one of the less coding-intensive projects. If you have any doubts, feel free to [contact me](/contact).

PS: Any of these projects require you to read the related work and understand the state-of-the-art in the field you select.


<ClientOnly>
<Thesis 
title="Full-Chasis Encountered-type Haptics for VR" 
abstract="Collaborative robots, used for haptics are composed by a set of links and joints. However, encountered-type Haptics typically uses makes use of the robot's end-effector (Last link of the chain). In this thesis, we will explore the design space, new opportunities and challenges that bring the use of all the links of the robot for providing encountered-type haptics"

<Thesis 
title="Finger-mounted Haptic Feedback for Topological Surface Rendering" 
abstract="Imagine how you interact with google maps; How can you know the altitude on the map?. Now imagine that you can feel the peaks of the mountains with your fingertips, the heigh difference between two spots with the deformation in your fingers. This thesis will replicate a state-of-the-art finger-mounted haptic device and test it in mobile interactions."

<Thesis 
title="Encountered-type Mid-air Haptics" 
abstract="Haptic interfaces are generally stimulation-specific; a given device has a (typically) very constrained range of rendering possibilities. Integration Kinaesthetic and Mid-air ultrasound haptics open the doors to a new time of interfaces capable of rendering a broad range of haptic sensations. In this thesis, you will explore the design space of these interfaces and run user studies to showcase the advantages and drawbacks of this setup."

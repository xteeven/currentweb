# Available Topics for thesis


Dear Bachelor's or Master's degree student, I've curated an exciting list of potential thesis topics for you to consider, which includes a working thesis title, abstract, and a list of skills you'll develop as you complete your work. Even if you have no prior experience with the areas, resources, or methods listed, you can still apply to work on a thesis with us. However, if you're not proficient in coding, you might want to consider one of the less technical projects (That consequently would require you to focus more in other aspects of the project). I'm [available](/contact) to answer any questions or concerns you might have.

Embarking on a thesis is a cool opportunity to explore new topics, acquire valuable knowledge, and acquire essential skills for Academia/Industry.

PS: Regardless of which option you choose, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the relevant literature and the current state of research in your chosen field.

<Thesis 
title="Peripheral vs Central Vision Information Presentation During Walking" 
abstract="This thesis aims to investigate the impact of the presentation of information on human walking behavior. Specifically, the study will compare the effects of three different display types - AR peripheral, Handheld, and Watch - on the speed and behavior of individuals checking information while on the move. Through a user study, the research seeks to gain insights into how the type of display used can influence human walking behavior and potentially lead to changes in design and use of such technologies in the future."

<Thesis 
title="Infinite Texture Rendering In Virtual Reality" 
abstract="Imagine a world where you cannot touch any object anymore; this world is currently called virtual reality. With the aim to enable the rendering of haptic textures in VR, we will explore how the combination of movement and vibration can create a haptic illusion of texture rendering in large scale."

<Thesis 
title="Human Augmentation and Enhance Performance Technologies" 
abstract="My research interests lie in the field of Augmentation Technologies, and I am keen to explore their impact on individuals' behaviors, including users, bystanders, and social groups. To investigate this topic in detail, I have developed a set of theoretical work and tools that will enable us to explore this area thoroughly.
As technology continues to evolve, it's essential to understand how it affects human behavior and interactions. Therefore, I am inviting students with a strong academic background and a passion for this field to join me in this exploration.
If you are interested in pursuing a thesis related to this topic and have a novel idea you would like to explore, or if you are intrigued by the concept of cyborgs, I encourage you to get in touch with me. Together, we can have a detailed discussion about potential research topics and how we can contribute to the existing knowledge base.
This academic journey promises to offer valuable insights into the impact of Augmentation Technologies on human behavior and interactions. I look forward to collaborating with students who share my curiosity and enthusiasm for this field of research"

<Thesis 
title="Communicating Emotions Using Haptic Stimulation on the Back" 
abstract="As the body's largest organ, the skin is home to thousands of mechanoreceptors that detect changes in motion, pressure, temperature, and pain. But most interfaces for communication rely on some sort of visual or auditory feedback. To complete this thesis, you will develop a system to detect people's feelings and provide haptic feedback to convey those feelings remotely."

<Thesis 
title="Augmenting Human Cognition Through AI Supported Triggers: The case of writting" 
abstract="Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have resulted in the development of groundbreaking technologies like GPT-3 and Stable Difussion. Artificial intelligence systems can now almost effortlessly carry out tasks that were previously thought to be difficult for AI but not for humans because they required some degree of creativity. However, while it is undeniable that human cognition has advanced over the centuries, this change has occurred at a slower rate. Within the context of this thesis, you will investigate the emerging field of human enhancement and computer-human interaction. What triggers based on AI can do for human writers"

<Thesis 
title="Augmenting Human Cognition Using Transcranial Direct Stimulation: Placebo Or Reality" 
abstract="The current state of the art of cognitive human-augmentations often relies on sensory inputs to support cognition (for example lifelogging technologies for increasing memory). This is not suprising giveng the few information we have about the human brain and its functions. However, Transcranial Stimulation stands out as the only technology that directly stimulates the human braing to alter it's functioning. In this thesis you will run a experiments comparing the effectivity of such technology"

abstract="Collaborative robots, used for haptics are composed by a set of links and joints. However, encountered-type Haptics typically uses makes use of the robot's end-effector (Last link of the chain). In this thesis, we will explore the design space, new opportunities and challenges that bring the use of all the links of the robot for providing encountered-type haptics"

<Thesis 
title="Encountered-type Mid-air Haptics" 
abstract="Haptic interfaces are generally stimulation-specific; a given device has a (typically) very constrained range of rendering possibilities. Integration Kinaesthetic and Mid-air ultrasound haptics open the doors to a new time of interfaces capable of rendering a broad range of haptic sensations. In this thesis, you will explore the design space of these interfaces and run user studies to showcase the advantages and drawbacks of this setup."

# Available Topics for thesis

Please find below a list of potential thesis topics for students pursuing a Bachelor's or Master's degree. You will also find a working thesis title, an abstract, and a list of the abilities you will hone as you complete the work. Applying to work on a thesis with me does not require any prior knowledge of the areas, resources, or methods listed below. But if you don't know how to code, you might want to look into one of the simpler projects. Don't hesitate to ask any questions you have, [contact me](/contact).

PS: Regardless of which option you choose, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the relevant literature and the current state of research in your chosen field.

<Thesis 
title="Communicating Emotions Using Haptic Stimulation on the Back" 
abstract="As the body's largest organ, the skin is home to thousands of mechanoreceptors that detect changes in motion, pressure, temperature, and pain. But most interfaces for communication rely on some sort of visual or auditory feedback. To complete this thesis, you will develop a system to detect people's feelings and provide haptic feedback to convey those feelings remotely."

<Thesis 
title="Augmenting Human Cognition Through AI Supported Triggers: The case of writting" 
abstract="Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have resulted in the development of groundbreaking technologies like GPT-3 and Stable Difussion. Artificial intelligence systems can now almost effortlessly carry out tasks that were previously thought to be difficult for AI but not for humans because they required some degree of creativity. However, while it is undeniable that human cognition has advanced over the centuries, this change has occurred at a slower rate. Within the context of this thesis, you will investigate the emerging field of human enhancement and computer-human interaction. What triggers based on AI can do for human writers"

<Thesis 
title="Augmenting Human Cognition Using Transcranial Direct Stimulation: Placebo Or Reality" 
abstract="The current state of the art of cognitive human-augmentations often relies on sensory inputs to support cognition (for example lifelogging technologies for increasing memory). This is not suprising giveng the few information we have about the human brain and its functions. However, Transcranial Stimulation stands out as the only technology that directly stimulates the human braing to alter it's functioning. In this thesis you will run a experiments comparing the effectivity of such technology"

<Thesis 
title="Full-Chasis Encountered-type Haptics for VR" 
abstract="Collaborative robots, used for haptics are composed by a set of links and joints. However, encountered-type Haptics typically uses makes use of the robot's end-effector (Last link of the chain). In this thesis, we will explore the design space, new opportunities and challenges that bring the use of all the links of the robot for providing encountered-type haptics"

<Thesis 
title="Finger-mounted Haptic Feedback for Topological Surface Rendering" 
abstract="Imagine how you interact with google maps; How can you know the altitude on the map?. Now imagine that you can feel the peaks of the mountains with your fingertips, the heigh difference between two spots with the deformation in your fingers. This thesis will replicate a state-of-the-art finger-mounted haptic device and test it in mobile interactions."

<Thesis 
title="Encountered-type Mid-air Haptics" 
abstract="Haptic interfaces are generally stimulation-specific; a given device has a (typically) very constrained range of rendering possibilities. Integration Kinaesthetic and Mid-air ultrasound haptics open the doors to a new time of interfaces capable of rendering a broad range of haptic sensations. In this thesis, you will explore the design space of these interfaces and run user studies to showcase the advantages and drawbacks of this setup."

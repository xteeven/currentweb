# Bio

Computer Scientist, Mechatronic Engineer, and Ph.D. Researcher in the Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media group at LMU Munich. My research field is human-computer interaction, particularly human augmentation/Human-computer Integration/Human-computer symbiosis. I'm highly interested in creating technologies to help humans overcome their natural sensory, cognitive, and motor limitations.
